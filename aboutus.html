                <h2>What We Do:</h2>
                <p>
                    Boiler Businesses is a platform that allows Purdue students to easily discover small businesses of the students on campus and helps small businesses find more possibly interested clients. There are many Purdue students who post on their social media about the services they offer such as haircuts, nail art, crocheting, tattoos, piercings, and so much more. Because this is the only way they can reach their audience of people specifically on Purdue’s campus, they struggle to make their business known to many. Boiler Businesses gives small businesses a platform to display their products and services to locals.

                <h2>Goals:</h2>
                <img class="goals" src="images/packaging .jpeg" alt="goals" />
                <p>Boiler Business’s goal is to help the small businesses of Purdue 
                find new clients and service opportunities. A common issue small businesses face is difficulty in getting their name and business discovered in society. We saw this issue and wanted to make a more easily accessible way to learn of Purdue’s small businesses. We not only want to make it easier for small businesses to find more clients, but also to help Purdue students find the product or service that best fits their needs. This platform allows Purdue students to see all the businesses on campus and see details about what they offer. Students can also rate the businesses and hear about other client’s experiences with their services and products.
